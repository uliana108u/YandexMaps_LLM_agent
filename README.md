# Assessing Organizations Relevance to Queries on Yandex.Maps using LLM Agent

```markdown
**Goal:** Building an LLM agent that evaluates the relevance of organizations on Yandex Maps to broad user queries. Its comparison with a strong baseline.

---

### Project Description

The project aims to research and implement approaches using Large Language Models (LLMs) for the task of **relevance estimation** of organizations to user queries.
The LLM agent analyzes input data (a user query and information about an organization), requests additional context via search if necessary, and outputs a binary decision: **whether the organization is relevant to the query or not**.

Both for the baseline and for all versions of the agent, the LLM used is: **gpt-4o-mini**. Quality metric: **Accuracy**.

The baseline â€” the model receives a fixed few-shot in-context learning prompt containing the query fields, information about the organization (name, address, category, and reviews), and examples from the training data, and must strictly respond: RELEVANT_PLUS or IRRELEVANT.

### Agent Architecture

The agent is structured as a graph of three nodes:

*   decide_need_search â€” decides whether a search for additional information is needed.
*   search â€” if necessary, performs a search via the Tavily API.
*   classify â€” evaluates relevance using the original data + search results.

The agent's behavior depends on the version of the prompts used (there are 3 in this project).

### Agent and Prompt Versions

ðŸ”¸ classify_v1.txt â€” Agent V1

The prompt structure is similar to the baseline.
If search is activated, external information is added to the Reviews field.
Uses the same classification logic, but with the ability to get more data.

ðŸ”¸ classify_v2.txt â€” Agent V2

External information is separated into a distinct "Additional Information" field, rather than being added to the "Reviews" field.
The prompt is supplemented with explicit checks for complex cases, especially regarding the address. An attempt to improve control over the context.

ðŸ”¸ classify_v3.txt â€” Agent V3

Same as version 2, but the search query is slightly modified: only the first organization name + category + address + query are taken. Lines containing "Missing" are removed from the search results.

### Search Decision (need_search)

ðŸ”¸ need_search_v1.txt

Simple YES/NO logic, without clear criteria.

ðŸ”¸ need_search_v2.txt

Clearly specifies when search is needed and when it is not. Examples and specific decision-making conditions.

ðŸ”¸ need_search_v3.txt
Temporary stub. Currently, this is a copy of need_search_v1.txt. And it is used to run agent 3.

### Used Libraries
openai: for calling OpenAI models (used everywhere)

LangGraph: defines the agent's action graph.

Tavily: source of external information (web search).

### Key Results

**Accuracy on validation (299 examples):**

* `baseline`: 0.6856
* `agent1`: **0.6957** (+1.01 p.p.)
* `agent2`: 0.6221
* `agent3`: 0.6388

**Accuracy on test (500 examples):**

* `baseline`: **0.7840**
* `agent1`: 0.7640
* `agent2`: 0.7360
* `agent3`: 0.7440

### Error Analysis

* **Consensus errors** (errors where all models make the same mistake):
  * Validation: 68 (22.74% of the dataset)
  * Test: 66 (13.2% of the dataset)
  * Up to ~70% of these are potentially related to annotation errors, indicating potential issues with target quality.

### Overall Conclusion

The experiments did not show a significant gain from using LLM agents compared to the baseline.
On the validation set, Agent1 shows a slight improvement, but on the test set â€” all agents underperform the baseline approach.

Despite this:

* Unique agent errors were identified (and some of them are not always real errors, but labeling errors), differing from the baseline errors, which indicates that the agents indeed use additional context and are capable of uncovering latent relevance/irrelevance through external web search. This suggests there is definite potential to outperform the baseline.

* A large share of consensus errors, coinciding with potential annotation errors, indicates that further model improvement may be limited by data quality (a high percentage of noise in the labels).
